As with all indoor plants, too much water, constantly wet leaves, and heavy, soggy soil.As it's a fast-growing plant, provide it with fertilizer once per month in the growing period (spring and summer) and slow down in the dormancy. GROWING INDOOR: Fortunately for indoor gardeners, Alocasias can grow well in pots, provided they get enough humidity and light. These plants are well known for their beautiful foliage and can brighten up any indoor space. This makes them a real treat to have in your home if you can care for them properly. SUNLIGHT: Bright Indirect light is when the sun's rays don't travel directly from the sun to your plant but, instead, bounce off something first. Plants in bright, indirect light will cast blurry, indistinct shadows. Bright indirect light is approximately 800-2000 foot candles. WATERING: Back to top The Alocasia Zebrina is a tropical plant, which means it needs a humid environment. If it gets too dry, it'll become vulnerable to pests. Luckily, there is a very simple way to keep this plant humid enough: mist it occasionally. It's best to do this at least once per week in the morning.",

Like anything with proper scheduling, reminding yourself of your plant’s health will become second nature to you. We recommend “Fiddle Leaf Fig Friday” and you can share photos of your plant on Instagram and tag #fiddleleaffigfriday!   2. Watering The best part of taking care of a fiddle leaf fig is that it doesn’t take much to actually keep it healthy. You may not even need to water it every week. One of the best ways to build confidence is to use a moisture meter to determine whether your plant needs water. Simply stick the meter in the soil about halfway between the trunk and the outside of the pot and about 3 inches down. A reading of 4 or less means your plant is ready to water! This is the best precaution you can put in place to ensure you don’t over-water or under-water your plant.   3. Fertilising Like water, food is critically important for your fiddle leaf fig. Soil can only provide so much support and gets depleted of nutrients within a few months. To optimize your plant’s health, it needs proper fertilisation for it to consume the essential nutrients and grow. By implementing this with your watering, you’re slowly becoming an expert in taking care of a fiddle leaf fig tree! Bonus Tip: Let There Be Light! Fiddle leaf figs love plenty of indirect light. They can get sunburnt in direct afternoon sunlight, but generally they do best in the sunniest part of your home. Try to put yours near the largest windows available with a southern-facing exposure if you live in the northern hemisphere. If your home lacks abundant light, you can try a grow light on your fiddle.",

They are perfect for indoors, since they can tolerate lower light. They do not like to stay dry for more than a day or two, especially when growing or blooming. Bloom season is winter and spring. WATERING: You can also water your orchid like a traditional houseplant – just apply a splash of water to the moss once every seven to 10 days. If the moss feels moist, you can wait a few days and check again before watering. Happily, orchids are surprisingly resilient when it comes to drying out when they're not in bloom.

During the late fall and winter, allow the soil to dry almost completely between waterings. Yellow discoloration is usually a sign that the plant is being overwatered, whereas brown & dry leaves indicate you should increase your watering frequency.Like most Philodendrons, the pedatum prefers 6 to 10 hours a day of bright, indirect light.

Keep plants in bright to moderate indirect sunlight. Spider plants do not appreciate direct, hot sunlight, which can burn their leaves, causing brown tips and spots. Spider plants grow fairly quickly and can easily become pot bound. Plan to repot a spider plant about every other year. Spider plants can be grown outdoors as annuals during the summer. They look especially good along the edge of a container or bed, as long as they are kept out of direct sunlight. HOW TO CARE SPIDER PLANT? During initial growth, water occasionally; once fully developed (within one year), water moderately. In the spring and summer months, keep the soil moist to encourage growth. Do not let soil dry out too much. Maintain average room temperature and humidity. Spider plants prefer temperatures between 55 and 80°F (13–27°C), which makes them a great indoor houseplant. Fertilize up to twice a month in the spring and summer, however, avoid over fertilization.",

Start decreasing water in late summer to early fall and trim back foliage when it starts to yellow. Dig up the tubers at the first threat of frost. Clean any remaining dirt from the tubers and dry them on newspaper in a sunny location for about a week. To prevent powdery mildew, lightly dust them with sulfur powder and store individually in paper bags or wrapped in newspaper. Rhizomatous and wax types don’t die back and are usually pinched or lightly pruned each year to keep them healthy and encourage full, but compact growth. In warmer climates, this is best done in spring. In cooler climates, you can do this in fall as a clean-up before bringing them inside for the winter. In addition to cutting them back, check for signs of pests or disease before moving them indoors. Slowly acclimate them to their new inside location by first placing in a bright window and gradually decreasing the amount of light. This will to help prevent stress, which causes the leaves to drop. Once warmer temperatures return, reverse the process and move them back outside. See below for information on growing as houseplants. For all types, deadheading spent begonia flowers keeps plants clean and healthy, as well as promotes more blooms.",

Site selection and soil are the most important considerations. The trees need deep, well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter.Apricot trees bloom early. There are times in apricot tree care where a late frost is a problem, so be sure to plant your trees on higher ground. Do a percolation test prior to planting by digging a hole one foot deep and wide (30 cm.). Fill with water and wait until the next day. Fill the hole again and lay a stick or straight edge over the top. Measure the water drop every hour. Ideal readings will be around 2 inches (5 cm.) per hour. Once you have adjusted the soil to have adequate drainage, dig a hole twice as deep and around as the root ball and plant your tree. Water in well.",

Water regularly; provide an inch (2.5 cm.) of water per week depending upon weather conditions. Allow 3-4 new canes per plant to grow to the top of the training wire or trellis. Keep the area around the plants free of weeds. In the first year of growing blackberry bushes, expect to have a small batch of fruit and a full harvest in the second year. After you see ripened fruit, try picking blackberries every three to six days. This prevents the birds from getting the berries before you do. Once the fruit has been harvested, prune out the fruiting canes which will not produce again. Fertilize new plants once new growth appears with a complete fertilizer such as 10-10-10 in the first year. Established plants should be fertilized before new spring growth emerges.",

Grapefruit trees, which can reach 22 to 30 feet at maturity, thrive in subtropical climates. Because the grapefruit tree is so cold-tender, select a planting site on the south side of your house to protect the tree from cold temperatures. Plant the tree about 12 feet away from the house so that the tree can receive full sunlight and to allow enough room for the grapefruit tree to grow. Plant your grapefruit tree in a location that is slightly higher than the rest of your yard to ensure proper drainage. Plant the tree so that the bud union, or grafting bud, is above the soil level. Cover the top of the root ball with only 1 inch of soil to prevent root rot. The grapefruit tree (Citrus paradisi) is the most frost-sensitive of citrus trees. Plant the tree about 12 feet away from the house so that the tree can receive full sunlight and to allow enough room for the grapefruit tree to grow.Make a water ring on top of the ground around the newly planted grapefruit tree by constructing a 3-inch ridge of soil 2 feet in diameter. Fill the inside of the ring with water and allow it to drain into the soil around the root ball. Water your grapefruit tree once every two or three days for the first three weeks after planting. Gradually decrease the frequency of watering to once every 7 to 10 days during the first growing season. Feed your grapefruit tree during the first year only after new growth emerges. Fertilize with 1 cup of ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) divided into three or four applications during the growing season. Spread the granular fertilizer on the ground around the root zone of the tree and water thoroughly. Make a water ring on top of the ground around the newly planted grapefruit tree by constructing a 3-inch ridge of soil 2 feet in diameter. Keep a 2- to 3-foot area around the base of the grapefruit tree free of weeds. You can pull the weeds by hand or apply a selective herbicide according to the directions on the label. Feed your grapefruit tree again in the second year with 2 cups of ammonium sulfate in the spring. Fertilize the tree in the third year with 3 cups of ammonium sulfate. Water your grapefruit tree once every one or two weeks during the second growing season and thereafter. Water the tree deeply, soaking the soil down to the entire root zone. Feed adult grapefruit trees 1 cup of ammonium sulfate for each year of age, up to 6 cups. Spread out the fertilizer feedings into three separate applications, in February, May and September. Keep a 2- to 3-foot area around the base of the grapefruit tree free of weeds. Protect your grapefruit tree whenever freezing temperatures or frosts threaten. You can drape a blanket or tarp over the tree and secure the edges to the ground with stakes. You also can mound up soil around the base of the tree to insulate the roots. Mound up the soil in late November and remove it in early March.",

Kaffir limes prefer full sun in moist, well-drained soil. If grown indoors, keep near a sunny window. The Kaffir lime tree appreciates water and somewhat humid conditions during the growing season. Keep in mind, however, that this tree is prone to root rot if kept too wet, so allow the soil to dry out some between waterings. Regular misting helps with humidity levels. Kaffir lime trees are cold sensitive and need to be protected from frost. Therefore, these plants should be brought indoors during winter if they are grown outside. They enjoy indoor temperatures around 60 F. (16 C.) or above, especially during winter months. Prune the lime tree while young to encourage branching and a more bushy plant.",

Apply a small amount of fertilizer early in the year. Add ⅛ pound of ammonium nitrate per tree multiplied by the number of years the tree has been set in moderately fertile soil. If you have highly fertile soil, use less fertilizer. If the leaves are pale green or yellowish during the summer, use a little more fertilizer the next year. If the tree grows more than 12 inches in one season, use less fertilizer the next year. Be very careful when applying fertilizer! If you give your trees too much nitrogen, they will become more susceptible to fire blight and also may focus too much energy on producing foliage instead of flowers and fruit.",

For bare root trees, soak the roots for six to twelve hours before planting. Dig your planting hole a few inches (7.6 cm.) deeper than and twice as wide as the tree’s root ball or root system. If your tree is grafted, make sure the bud union is planted a couple inches (5 cm.) above the soil. If your tree is bare root, leave plenty of room for the roots to spread. Fill the hole half way with soil and water it well. When it drains, check to see if the tree is still positioned correctly, then fill the rest of the hole with soil. Water again and mulch around the trunk. It’s a good idea to construct a 3- to 6-inch (7.6-15 cm.) berm of soil around the tree’s root zone to help contain water and mulch. After planting, trim the tree back to 26 to 30 inches (66-76 cm.), removing its side branches. This will help your tree produce a better crop. HOW TO CARE PEACH PLANT? Fertilize your peach tree in spring using one pound of 10-10-10 fertilizer for new trees and an additional pound each year until your tree is 10 feet (3 m.) high. Plan to prune your peach tree each year in spring, making sure the center of the tree has a free flow of air and sunlight. Pay close attention to your peach tree throughout the year to address any problems that may arise like peach leaf curl and browning, or diseases and pests. It takes some attentiveness and a bit of focus but growing a peach tree can be a gratifying and enjoyable project.",

Thyme will rarely need watering apart from during very prolonged periods of dry or drought conditions in summer. Ensure plants in pots are not allowed to completely dry out. Thyme doesn’t like rich soil, but will benefit from a light feeding of a high potash plant food in spring. Give plants a liquid feed during summer to improve growth, flavour and flowering. Trim plants after flowering with secateurs or shears to keep them compact and to promote fresh, new growth. Thyme is rarely troubled by any pests or diseases. Soft growth, promoted by rich soils or overfeeding with high nitrogen plant foods, may encourage aphids.",
